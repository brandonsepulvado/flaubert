# NLP with Flaubert

## Purpose
Natural language processing with non-English texts can be difficult because many NLP resources are designed for English data. The data manipulation and analyses in this repository serve to deepen my knowledge of taxt analysis with French.

## Data
I will download of all Flaubert's works present on Project Gutenberg.
